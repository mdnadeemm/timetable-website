# Side Panel Implementation for Task Management

## Overview
Replace popup dialogs with a persistent side panel that shows task management and event editing with tab navigation.

## Requirements Analysis
- **Side Panel**: Task panel appears on the right side when events are clicked
- **Toggle Behavior**: Click same event again to hide panel, click different event to switch
- **Tab Navigation**: Two tabs - "Tasks" and "Edit Event"
- **Persistent State**: Panel remains open until explicitly closed or same event clicked again

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Create Side Panel Component
- [x] Create TaskPanel component with tab functionality
- [x] Implement panel show/hide logic
- [x] Add tab switching between Tasks and Edit Event

### Phase 2: Update Layout
- [x] Modify TimetableGrid to use side panel instead of dialogs
- [x] Remove popup dialog references
- [x] Update responsive design for panel

### Phase 3: Event Interaction Changes
- [x] Update TimetableGrid click handlers
- [x] Remove popup dialogs and replace with panel state
- [x] Implement panel toggle logic

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [x] Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] Test build functionality
- [x] Ensure all features work correctly

## Usage Instructions

4. **Use the tabs** to switch between Tasks and Edit Event
5. **Manage tasks** in the Tasks tab with full CRUD functionality
